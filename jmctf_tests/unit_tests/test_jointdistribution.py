        # the second term of the calculation. So let's just change it a
        # little and hope that the result is still valid for the underlying
        # model.

        # Next need to consider shape of s - s_0
        # This is a little complicated, because there are two possibilities:
        # 1. For each hypothesis in s, we may want to evaluate its likelihood under *every* sample
        # 2. We may have one test hypothesis for each sample (e.g. in case we are using "quad" to improve on some fit result)
        #    In this second case, the size of s needs to match the number of samples.
        #
        # But how do detect which situation we are in?
        # If s.shape = (N,ni), should assign one element of s per sample
        # If s.shape = (nH,ni), should evaluate all hypotheses for all samples
        # but this leads to ambiguity if nH==N.
        # So need something more robust.
        # Need to use broadcasting of batch_shapes. There is a batch_shape for the samples/fitted parameters,
        # and another batch_shape for the input hypothesis list. Need to use these to infer broadcasting
        # behaviour.
        # Essentially it is the "all hypotheses for all samples" case which will need the more complicated
        # shape. 
        
        # Should be able to use "normal" rules for log_prob evaluation?

        # 1. sample.shape is compared to (batch_shape,event_shape). Let len(batch_shape,event_shape)=n. 
        #    If sample.shape has fewer dimensions, pad them on the left with singleton dimensions.
        # 2. Broadcast the n right-most dimensions of sample against (batch_shape,event_shape). The remaining
        #    dimensions are interpreted as sample_shape.
        # 3. Result will have shape (sample_shape,batch_shape), since each whole event_shape part is used for
        #    one log_prob evaluation.
        
        # 1. We want to evaluate at nH points, so look at s.shape to obtain batch_shape, which plays the role of
        #    the "distribution" batch_shape.
        #
        # 2. s_0 matches with the sample here, so numpy-style broadcast the batch_shape of s_0 against s.batch_shape
        #    any "leftover" dims on the left of the sample dims become the "sample_shape" dims.
        #
        # 3. Do computation such that resulting log_prob_quad shape is (sample_shape,batch_shape)
        #
        # In this paradigm, to achieve the scenario (1) and (2) results, we need the following input shapes:
        # (1) s.shape               = (N,ni)   "distribution"
        #     s_0.shape             = (N,ni)   "samples"
        #     output log_prob.shape = (N,)     "log_prob"
        #
        # (2) s.shape               =   (nH,ni)  "distribution"
        #     s_0.shape             = (N,1, ni)  "samples"
        #     output log_prob.shape = (N,nH)     "log_prob"
        #
        # So for scenario 2 we need to know how to get those extra "nH" batch dimensions into s_0. This needs to be done
        # when the corresponding JointDistribution is set up, so we have to do it by changing the shape of the parameters
        # input to that distribution.


        # The two situations that we want to work smoothly are:
        # 1. Evaluate likelihoods for a list of hypothesis for all samples

        # 2. Fit nuisance parameters to all samples
        #    log_prob, joint_fitted_nuisance, fitted_pars_nuisance = joint0.fit_nuisance(samples)
        #    # Parameters have shape (N,par_shape)
        #    #print("fitted_pars_nuisance['all']:", fitted_pars_nuisance['all'])
        #    f = joint_fitted_nuisance.log_prob_quad_f(samples)
        #    log_prob_quad = f(fitted_pars_nuisance['fixed']) # the 'fixed' parameters include the 'signal' ones
        #    # Expect to get back log_prob_quad.shape = (N,), i.e. one for each fitted parameter


        # So, to make all this work, shapes should be:
        # N - number/shape of samples
        # nt - number of nuisance parameters (1D, flattened)
        # ni - number of 'interest' parameters (1D, flattened)
        # 
        # A.shape = (N,nt)
        # B.shape = (N,nt,ni)
        # s_0.shape = (N, ni) # Can expand around same point for each sample, or different point (e.g. global best fit)
        #          or (N, 1, ni) # all test points to be used for all expansion points/samples
        # s.shape = (nH,ni)
        #        or (ni,) if only one test point needed 
        #

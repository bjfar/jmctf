Welcome to JMC-TF!
===================================

Python tools for perfoming Monte-Carlo studies of joint distribution
functions consisting of many components, powered by TensorFlow.

These tools are fairly simple wrappers of scipy.stats objects, made
for convenience rather than speed. Effort has been taken to make them
pretty efficient, but if you use them to construct and analyse monstrously large
joint PDFs then things will not be fast. For such intense usage you
will need a more specialised (and more complicated!) toolkit, such as 
`ROOT`_.
